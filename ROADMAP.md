# API Roadmap
- Improving modules documentation.
    - Explaining what each function does.
- Routes documentation.
    - Explaining how each route operates, what data can be pushed, etc.
- ~~Move to using [orm](https://github.com/encode/orm)~~, Only partly integrated, waiting for more completed library before continuing on.
    - Sadly we won't be using [dashboard](https://github.com/encode/dashboard) due to it's early development & some records in the database being directly edited could cause issues, e.g. if the edited record is cached somewhere else or needs validation from a third party.
- Setup script
    - Script to automate production deploying.
- Login module.
    - Attaching discord & steam accounts to a user id.
    - Deleting & editing logins.
    - Alt detection & VPN blocking using [proxycheck.io](https://proxycheck.io/)
    - Logging events using Websocket.
- Ban module.
    - Adding a ban to a user id, ban length is based off the ban severity value and the rep loss value assigned to the ban type.
    - Removing bans.
    - Logging events using Websocket.
- Demo saving.
    - Using [ftp module](https://github.com/aio-libs/aioftp) to download demo files and uploading them to [b2](https://github.com/WardPearce/aiob2) or [s3](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore).
- Graphql.
    - Adding a [graphql](https://www.starlette.io/graphql/) endpoint with alternatives to the REST endpoints.
